# Exploratoria 

## 🏆 Introduction
Exploratoria is a 2D top-down experience that takes inspiration from museums to provide an enjoyable learning experience. Through the use of a 16-bit art style, we incorporated the feeling of playing an actual arcade machine into a modern game. It won first place at the Colorado Technology Student Association competition.

## 🛠 Code Structure

Code for the game was built around the `"LevelMovement"` script, which is found at: Assets/Scripts/MainScripts/LevelMovement.cs

This script keeps track of:
- Points
- Time
- Levels
- Plaques

Many secondary scripts were created to give each level and minigame its own unique feel.

## 🎮 How to Play

The game can be played online at [itch.io](https://noahschwartz.itch.io/exploratoria).
- WASD or Arrow Keys move the player forward, left, back, and right. 
- The space bar lets players enter arcade games, launch rockets, and mine in the game. 
- The arcade game or event in a room must be played to move on.
