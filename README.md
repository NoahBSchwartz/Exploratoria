# Exploratoria
Exploratoria is a 2D top-down experience that takes inspiration from museums to provide an enjoyable learning experience. Through the use of a 16-bit art style, we incorporated the feeling of playing an actual arcade machine into a modern game. The end goal of the project was to educate the player in a compelling manner. Code for the game was built around the "levelMovement" (Exploratoria/Assets/Scripts/MainScripts/LevelMovement.cs) script which keeps track of points, time, levels, and displays the plaques. Many secondary scripts were created to give each level and minigame its own unique feel. The game can be played online at: https://noahschwartz.itch.io/exploratoria.
