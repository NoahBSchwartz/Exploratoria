# Exploratoria 

## 🏆 Introduction
  Exploratoria is a 2D top-down experience that takes inspiration from museums to provide an enjoyable learning experience. Through the use of a 16-bit art style, we incorporated the feeling of playing an actual arcade machine into a modern game. It won first place at the Colorado Technology Student Association competition!

## 🛠 Code Structure

Code for the game was built around the `"levelMovement"` script, which is found at: Assets/Scripts/MainScripts/LevelMovement.cs


This script keeps track of:
- Points
- Time
- Levels
- Displays the plaques

Many secondary scripts were created to give each level and minigame its own unique feel.

## 🎮 How to Play

The game can be played online at: [Exploratoria on itch.io](https://noahschwartz.itch.io/exploratoria).
(Add a section here detailing the controls, rules, and how to navigate through the game.)
